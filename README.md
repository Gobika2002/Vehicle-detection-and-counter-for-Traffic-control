# 🚗 Vehicle Detection and Counter for Traffic Control

A Python + OpenCV project that detects and counts vehicles in real time from video footage. Designed to support intelligent traffic monitoring, this system uses background subtraction and contour detection to identify vehicles crossing a defined line and increment a counter.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time vehicle detection using background subtraction
- Contour-based bounding box and center tracking
- Dynamic vehicle counting with line crossing logic
- Adjustable detection thresholds and error offset
- Works with pre-recorded video or live webcam feed

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vehicle-counter.git
cd vehicle-counter
pip install -r requirements.txt
